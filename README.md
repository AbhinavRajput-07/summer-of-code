# summer-of-code
This repository consistes of the work which i had done during my summer of code in the project algorithmic trading in python</br>
In this project i had learned about the working principles of stock market, how trades happens, about various technical indicators which traders use to optimize their stocks selection.</br>
Then i learned about various method of creating strategy using indicators. Which helped me in creating optimized strategy for the data which my mentors provided.</br>
Later in the project  i learned about backtesting the data and the libraries which we use for building strategies like numpy and pandas and others.</br>
Then finally i built my first trading strategy based on the momemtum trading model.


For the final phases of project the backtester was quite a bit modified thus i need to modify my strategies depending on the new backtester basically the code to incorporate the new changes.

But the main strategy i used was momentum only i sticked to this strategy and this strategy worked well on the most data sets provided and just gave loss for one data set.
